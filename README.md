# ðŸ”— Jourdan's LittleLink

LittleLink is a lightweight DIY alternative to services like [Linktree](https://linktr.ee)
and [many.link](https://many.link/). LittleLink was built using [Skeleton](http://getskeleton.com/), a dead simple, responsive boilerplateâ€”we just stripped out some additional code you wouldn't need and added in branded styles for popular services. LittleLink has more than 50+ branded button styles you can use (with even more being added by our community). You'll also find a light and dark theme ready to go.

No need for gulp, npm, or anything else to make LittleLink workâ€”it uses the bare essentials. You can automatically fork and deploy LittleLink with [Vercel](https://vercel.com/). Enjoy free and fast hosting with automatic deployments on every branch push with one click below.
